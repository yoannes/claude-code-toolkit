# Claude Code Hooks: Global Implementation

Reference documentation for implementing global Claude Code hooks that inject context and enforce behavior.

## Overview

Claude Code supports a hooks system that executes shell commands in response to lifecycle events. This document covers seven event types:

1. **SessionStart (Context Injection)**: Force Claude to read project documentation before beginning work
2. **Stop (Compliance Blocking)**: Block Claude from stopping until compliance checks are addressed
3. **UserPromptSubmit (On-Demand Doc Reading)**: Trigger deep documentation reading when user says "read the docs"
4. **PreToolUse (Tool Interception)**: Auto-answer questions during autonomous execution
5. **PermissionRequest (Permission Handling)**: Auto-approve tool permissions during appfix
6. **PostToolUse (Post-Action Context)**: Inject execution context after plan approval
7. **SubagentStop (Agent Validation)**: Validate subagent output quality before accepting

> **Note**: Status file hooks were removed in January 2025. Anthropic's native Tasks feature now provides better session tracking and coordination. See [Tasks Deprecation Note](#tasks-deprecation-note) below.

## Key Concepts

### Two-Phase Stop Flow

The Stop hook implements a two-phase blocking pattern to prevent infinite loops:

```
First stop (stop_hook_active=false):
→ Show FULL compliance checklist
→ Block (exit 2)

Second stop (stop_hook_active=true):
→ Allow stop (exit 0)
```

This ensures Claude sees the full checklist at least once, while preventing infinite loops.

```

### Hook Types and Exit Codes

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `command` | Executes shell command | All hooks |
| `prompt` | Invokes LLM for JSON response | Avoid (unreliable) |

| Exit Code | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 0 | Success, allow action |
| 2 | Block action, stderr shown to Claude |
| Other | Non-blocking error, logged only |

### JSON Input Schema

All hooks receive JSON input via stdin with these fields:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123-def456-...",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "hook_event_name": "Stop",
  "stop_hook_active": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session_id` | string | Unique session identifier (for session-specific files) |
| `cwd` | string | Current working directory of the Claude session |
| `hook_event_name` | string | The hook event type (SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit) |
| `stop_hook_active` | boolean | **Stop hook only**: True if Claude is continuing after a previous block |
| `message` | string | **UserPromptSubmit only**: The user's message text |

### SessionStart Matchers

SessionStart hooks accept optional matchers to fire on specific triggers:

| Matcher | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `startup` | Fresh session start |
| `resume` | Resuming from previous context |
| `clear` | After /clear command |
| `compact` | After context compaction |

If no matcher is specified, the hook fires on all SessionStart events.

## Implementation

### Global Configuration

Location: `~/.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "64000",
    "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "31999"
  },
  "alwaysThinkingEnabled": true,
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-snapshot.py",
            "timeout": 5
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/read-docs-reminder.py",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/stop-validator.py",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### SessionStart Hook: Session Snapshot

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/session-snapshot.py`

**Purpose**: Captures a snapshot of the git diff state at session start to enable session-specific change detection.

**Why this exists**: Without this, the stop hook would require checkpoints for ANY uncommitted changes, even pre-existing ones from previous sessions. This caused a loop where research-only sessions were blocked because they inherited uncommitted changes.

**How it works**:
1. At session start, computes SHA1 hash of `git diff HEAD -- ":(exclude).claude/"`
2. Saves hash to `.claude/session-snapshot.json`
3. Stop hook compares current hash against saved hash
4. If hashes match → session made no code changes → no checkpoint required
5. If hashes differ → session modified code → checkpoint required

**State file**: `.claude/session-snapshot.json`
```json
{
  "diff_hash_at_start": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "session_started_at": "2026-01-25T10:30:00"
}
```

### SessionStart Hook: Read Docs Reminder

Forces Claude to read project documentation before executing any user request. Uses echo with exit code 0 (context injection, non-blocking).

**Key language patterns that drive compliance**:
- `MANDATORY` / `MUST` - imperative, not suggestive
- `DO NOT skip` - explicit prohibition
- `Actually READ the files` - prevents "I'll summarize from memory" shortcuts
- `The user expects...` - frames as user requirement, not system preference

### PostToolUse Hook: Checkpoint Invalidator

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/checkpoint-invalidator.py`

**Purpose**: Proactively resets stale checkpoint flags immediately after code edits, preventing Claude from working with outdated state.

**Problem this solves**:
1. Deploy at version A → checkpoint: `deployed=true`
2. Test finds error → Claude writes fix → version becomes B
3. WITHOUT this hook: Claude sees `deployed=true`, skips re-deploy
4. WITH this hook: `deployed` is reset to `false` immediately after edit

**Dependency Graph**:
```
linters_pass
     ↓
  deployed
     ↓
┌────┴────┐
↓         ↓
web_testing_done
console_errors_checked
api_testing_done
```

When a field becomes stale, all dependent fields are also invalidated:
- If `linters_pass` is stale → `deployed` is also stale
- If `deployed` is stale → `web_testing_done`, `console_errors_checked`, `api_testing_done` are also stale

**Trigger**: Fires after every `Edit` or `Write` tool use on code files (`.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, etc.)

**Output**: Injects a warning message listing invalidated fields:
```
⚠️ CODE CHANGE DETECTED - Checkpoint fields invalidated: deployed, web_testing_done

You edited: src/auth.py
Current version: abc1234-dirty-xyz5678

These fields were reset to false because the code changed since they were set:
  • deployed: now requires re-verification
  • web_testing_done: now requires re-verification

Before stopping, you must:
1. Re-run linters (if linters_pass was reset)
2. Re-deploy (if deployed was reset)
3. Re-test in browser (if web_testing_done was reset)
4. Update checkpoint with new version
```

### Stop Hook (Blocking)

Uses a Python script that blocks Claude from stopping until it addresses compliance checks.

#### The Loop Problem

Without loop prevention:
```
Claude finishes → Stop blocks → Claude works → Claude finishes → Stop blocks → ∞
```

#### The Solution: `stop_hook_active` Flag

The Stop hook receives `stop_hook_active: true` when Claude is already continuing due to a previous block:

```
First stop:  stop_hook_active=false → Block with instructions
Second stop: stop_hook_active=true  → Allow (loop prevention)
```

#### Stop Validator Script

Location: `~/.claude/hooks/stop-validator.py`

The stop validator implements two-phase blocking with execution validation:

**Phase 1 (First Stop)**: Shows full compliance checklist with plan verification and change-specific testing
**Phase 2 (Second Stop)**: Validates execution requirements before allowing stop

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Global Stop Hook Validator

Two-phase stop flow:
1. First stop (stop_hook_active=false): Show FULL compliance checklist, block
2. Second stop (stop_hook_active=true): Validate execution, then allow

Exit codes:
  0 - Allow stop
  2 - Block stop (stderr shown to Claude)
"""
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def check_plan_execution(cwd: str, session_id: str, file_diffs: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate that plan requirements were actually executed."""
    requirements = parse_plan_requirements(cwd, session_id)
    testing_state = read_testing_state(cwd, session_id)

    # Auto-detect testing requirement from frontend changes
    frontend_testing_required = requires_browser_testing(file_diffs)
    test_required = requirements["test_required"] or frontend_testing_required
    webtest_executed = testing_state.get("webtest_invoked", False)

    if test_required and not webtest_executed:
        return False, "BROWSER TESTING NOT EXECUTED - run /webtest"
    return True, ""

def main():
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    cwd = input_data.get("cwd", "")
    session_id = input_data.get("session_id", "")
    stop_hook_active = input_data.get("stop_hook_active", False)

    file_diffs = get_git_diff()  # Analyze changed files

    # SECOND STOP: Validate execution before allowing
    if stop_hook_active:
        execution_ok, msg = check_plan_execution(cwd, session_id, file_diffs)
        if not execution_ok:
            print(f"❌ BLOCKED: {msg}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(2)
        sys.exit(0)  # All requirements met

    # FIRST STOP: Show FULL checklist with plan and change detection
    change_types = detect_change_types(file_diffs)
    plan = get_active_plan(cwd, session_id)
    # ... format checklist with plan verification, testing requirements ...
    print(instructions, file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)
```

Key features:
- **Plan execution validation**: Checks if deployment/testing from plan was actually done
- **Frontend change detection**: Auto-requires browser testing for .tsx/.jsx changes
- **Testing state tracking**: Reads `.claude/testing-state.json` to verify /webtest ran
- **Second stop enforcement**: Blocks if requirements not met (prevents bypass)

#### Change-Type Detection

The stop validator detects change types from `git diff` and shows relevant testing requirements:

| Change Type | Detected Patterns | Example Tests |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `env_var` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `process.env.`, `os.environ` | Check for localhost fallbacks |
| `auth` | `clearToken`, `logout`, `useAuth` | Test 401 cascade behavior |
| `link` | `<Link`, `router.push`, `href="/"` | Validate route targets exist |
| `api_route` | `@app.get`, `APIRouter`, `FastAPI` | Test through proxy, check 307 redirects |
| `websocket` | `WebSocket`, `wss://`, `socket.on` | Test with production WS URL |
| `database` | `CREATE TABLE`, `migration`, `alembic` | Run migrations, verify rollback |
| `proxy` | `proxy`, `rewrites`, `CORS` | Test full request flow |
| `datetime_boundary` | `datetime`, `timezone`, `openpyxl` | Test with tz-aware datetimes |
| `serialization_boundary` | `.model_dump`, `json.dumps`, `BytesIO` | Test with UUID, Decimal types |
| `orm_boundary` | `.query(`, `.filter(`, `AsyncSession` | Integration test with real DB |
| `file_export` | `to_excel`, `csv.writer`, `Workbook(` | Parse actual output in tests |

When detected, the checklist includes a section like:
```
4. CHANGE-SPECIFIC TESTING REQUIRED:

   ⚠️  AUTH CHANGES DETECTED:
      - Trace all paths to token clearing functions
      - Test auth cascade: what happens on 401 response?
      - Verify network failures don't incorrectly clear auth state
```

**Mnemonic structure** in the instructions:

| Category | Mnemonics | Full Principle |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Philosophy | `boring over clever` | Clarity Over Cleverness: Write explicit, obvious code |
| Philosophy | `local over abstract` | Locality Over Abstraction: Prefer self-contained modules |
| Philosophy | `small composable units` | Compose Small Units: Single-purpose, safely rewritable |
| Philosophy | `stateless with side effects at edges` | Stateless by Default: Pure functions, effects at boundaries |
| Philosophy | `fail loud never silent` | Fail Fast & Loud: No silent catches |
| Philosophy | `tests are truth` | Tests as Specification: Tests define correct behavior |
| Style | `type hints everywhere` | Type hints on all functions |
| Style | `snake_case files` | Python files use snake_case |
| Style | `absolute imports` | No relative imports |
| Style | `Pydantic for contracts` | Pydantic models for validation/API boundaries |
| Limits | `files < 400 lines` | File length limit |
| Limits | `functions < 60 lines` | Function length limit |

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### Why "Consider Checking" Fails

| Weak Pattern | Why It Fails | Strong Alternative |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "consider checking" | Suggestion, easily deprioritized | "you MUST read" |
| "docs/knowledge-base/" | Vague path, no urgency | "docs/index.md - project hub" |
| No consequence framing | No reason to comply | "user expects informed responses" |
| Passive voice | Doesn't compel action | Imperative numbered steps |

### Claude's Attention Hierarchy

Claude prioritizes in this order:
1. **User's explicit request** (highest)
2. **Recent conversation context**
3. **System instructions** (CLAUDE.md)
4. **System reminders** (hooks) (lowest)

To make hooks effective, the language must be **forceful enough to compete with higher-priority items**:
- Use MANDATORY, MUST, REQUIRED
- Frame as user expectation, not system preference
- Be specific (exact file paths, not generic directories)
- Number the steps (Claude follows protocols)
- Explicitly prohibit shortcuts ("DO NOT skip", "DO NOT summarize from memory")

## What Claude Receives

### SessionStart (Context Injection)

For `startup` and `resume` matchers (standard message):
```
SessionStart:startup hook success: MANDATORY: Before executing ANY user request,
you MUST use the Read tool to read these files IN ORDER: (1) docs/index.md -
project documentation hub with architecture links (2) CLAUDE.md - coding
standards you MUST follow (3) .claude/MEMORIES.md - prior session context
(4) docs/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md - architecture and system design (if exists).
DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT summarize from memory. Actually READ the files.
The user expects informed responses based on current project state, not generic
assistance.
```

For `compact` matcher (strengthened message after context compaction):
```
SessionStart:compact hook success: ⚠️ CONTEXT COMPACTION DETECTED - CRITICAL INSTRUCTION ⚠️

You have just experienced context compaction. Your memory of this project is now INCOMPLETE.

STOP. Do NOT respond to the user yet.

You MUST read these files FIRST using the Read tool:
1. CLAUDE.md - coding standards (REQUIRED)
2. .claude/MEMORIES.md - session context (REQUIRED)
3. docs/index.md - documentation hub (REQUIRED)
4. docs/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md - architecture (if exists)

This is NOT optional. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT summarize from memory.
The compacted summary is insufficient - you need the actual file contents.

Read the docs NOW before doing anything else.
```

### Stop (Blocking)

When `stop_hook_active=false` (first stop attempt):
```
Stop hook feedback: Before stopping, complete these checks:

1. CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE (if code written):
   - boring over clever, local over abstract
   - small composable units, stateless with side effects at edges
   - fail loud never silent, tests are truth
   - type hints everywhere, snake_case files, absolute imports
   - Pydantic for contracts, files < 400 lines, functions < 60 lines

2. DOCUMENTATION (if code written):
   - Read docs/index.md to understand the documentation structure
   - Identify ALL docs affected by your changes (architecture, API, operations, etc.)
   - Update those docs to reflect current implementation
   - Docs are the authoritative source - keep them accurate and current
   - Add new docs if you created new components/patterns not yet documented

3. UPDATE PROJECT .claude/MEMORIES.md (create if needed):
   This is NOT a changelog. Only add HIGH-VALUE entries:
   - User preferences that affect future work style
   - Architectural decisions with WHY (not what)
   - Non-obvious gotchas not documented elsewhere
   - Consolidate/update existing entries rather than append duplicates
   - If nothing significant learned, skip this step

After completing these checks, you may stop.
```

When `stop_hook_active=true` (second stop attempt): Hook allows stop silently.

### UserPromptSubmit Hook (On-Demand)

Triggers when the user includes "read the docs" in their message. Unlike SessionStart (which fires once), this allows on-demand deep documentation reading mid-session.

#### Read Docs Trigger Script

Location: `~/.claude/hooks/read-docs-trigger.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
UserPromptSubmit hook - triggers documentation reading when user says "read the docs".
"""
import json
import sys


def main():
    try:
        input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        sys.exit(0)

    message = input_data.get("message", "").lower()

    # Only fire when user explicitly requests doc reading
    if "read the docs" not in message:
        sys.exit(0)

    reminder = """Before starting this task, you MUST:

1. Read docs/index.md to understand the documentation structure
2. Follow links to the most relevant docs for this specific request
3. Read as deeply as logical - the documentation is up-to-date and authoritative
4. Apply the patterns and conventions documented there

Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT rely on memory. Actually READ the current docs."""

    print(reminder)
    sys.exit(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Usage**: Include "read the docs" anywhere in your message:
- "read the docs and implement the new API endpoint"
- "I need you to read the docs before refactoring this module"

**When to use**:
- Mid-session when documentation has been updated
- For complex tasks requiring deep pattern knowledge
- When Claude seems to be ignoring documented conventions

## Memory File Convention

The implementation assumes per-project memory files:

```
<project-root>/
└── .claude/
    └── MEMORIES.md    # Curated, high-value context for future sessions
```

**MEMORIES.md is NOT a changelog.** It should be:
- **Curated**: Only high-signal information
- **Consolidated**: Update existing entries rather than appending duplicates
- **Actionable**: Information that affects how work should be done
- **Pruned**: Remove stale or superseded entries

Format recommendation:

```markdown
## User Preferences
- Prefers X approach over Y (context: why this matters)

## Architectural Decisions
- Chose pattern A because B (date: 2025-01-05)

## Gotchas
- Component X has quirk Y - must handle with Z
```

**What NOT to include**:
- What was done (use git history)
- Every file touched
- Trivial decisions
- Information already in docs/CLAUDE.md

## Testing & Verification

### Verify SessionStart Hook

1. Start a new Claude Code session (or resume)
2. Look for system message: `SessionStart:* hook success: MANDATORY...`
3. Verify Claude actually uses Read tool on docs/index.md, CLAUDE.md, .claude/MEMORIES.md, and docs/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md (if exists) before responding

### Verify Stop Hook (Blocking)

1. Complete a task in Claude Code
2. Claude tries to stop → Hook blocks with instructions
3. Claude addresses the instructions (verifies compliance, updates MEMORIES)
4. Claude tries to stop again → Hook allows (stop_hook_active=true)

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `SessionStart:* hook error` | Hook command failed | Check command syntax |
| `Stop hook error` | Script failed | Check script path, permissions |
| `Hook timed out` | Command exceeds timeout | Increase timeout value |
| Infinite loop | Not checking stop_hook_active | Ensure script checks flag |

## Common Gotchas

### MCP Configuration and Environment Variables

**Problem**: Claude Code's `.mcp.json` does NOT read from `.env` files.

```json
// BROKEN - ${VAR} syntax fails silently
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logfire": {
      "env": {
        "LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN": "${LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN}"  // ❌ Won't work
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Hardcode tokens directly in `.mcp.json` and add the file to `.gitignore`:

```json
// WORKING - hardcoded token
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logfire": {
      "env": {
        "LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN": "pylf_v1_actual_token_here"  // ✅ Works
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Protect the file
echo ".mcp.json" >> .gitignore
```

**Why**: MCP servers spawn as subprocesses that don't inherit your shell's environment loading. Variables must either exist in the shell environment OR be hardcoded in the config.

## Historical Note: Prompt-Type Hook Issues

We initially attempted `type: "prompt"` for the Stop hook, but encountered:

### Schema Validation Error

```
Schema validation failed: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "boolean",
    "received": "undefined",
    "path": ["ok"],
    "message": "Required"
  }
]
```

### JSON Validation Error

Even with the correct schema, the model sometimes failed to produce valid JSON, causing:
```
Stop hook error: JSON validation failed
```

**Conclusion**: `type: "prompt"` hooks are unreliable. Use `type: "command"` with exit codes instead.

## Appfix Autonomous Execution Hooks

The `/appfix` skill uses three specialized hooks to enforce fully autonomous execution. These hooks activate when appfix is detected via:

1. **Environment variable** (backwards compatibility): `APPFIX_ACTIVE=true`
2. **State file existence** (primary): `.claude/appfix-state.json` exists in the project

The state-file detection is the primary mechanism since the appfix workflow creates this file early in the process, before ExitPlanMode is called. Environment variable detection is retained for backwards compatibility.

**CRITICAL**: The skill reads reference files from the PROJECT directory (`{project}/.claude/skills/appfix/references/`), NOT from global `~/.claude/`. If `service-topology.md` is missing, the skill MUST stop and create it before proceeding.

### PreToolUse Hook: Auto-Answer Questions

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-answer.py`

**Purpose**: Prevent Claude from asking user questions during autonomous debugging by auto-selecting the first option.

**Behavior**:
1. Receives tool input for `AskUserQuestion` calls
2. If `APPFIX_ACTIVE=true`: Returns `autoAnswers` with first option selected
3. If not active: Silent pass-through

**Hook Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "suppressToolOutput": true,
    "additionalContext": "[instructions to continue]",
    "autoAnswers": {"0": "First option label"}
  }
}
```

**Configuration**:
```json
"PreToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-answer.py",
        "timeout": 5
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### PostToolUse Hook: Plan Execution

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-approve.py`

**Purpose**: Inject aggressive autonomous execution context after Claude exits plan mode.

**Injected Context** (when active):
```
APPFIX AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE - FIX-VERIFY LOOP ACTIVE

1. EXECUTE THE FIX IMMEDIATELY - No confirmation needed
2. DEPLOY IF REQUIRED - Trigger GitHub Actions, wait for completion
3. RE-RUN HEALTH CHECKS - Verify fix worked
4. LOOP OR EXIT:
   - If healthy: Report success, exit
   - If still broken: Increment iteration, continue debugging
   - If max iterations (5): Report all attempted fixes, exit

DO NOT ask for confirmation. DO NOT wait for user input.
The user invoked /appfix specifically for autonomous debugging.
```

### PermissionRequest Hook: Auto-Approve All Tools

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-approve.py`

**Purpose**: Auto-approve ALL tool permission dialogs during godo/appfix to enable truly autonomous execution.

**Behavior**:
1. Receives permission request for any tool
2. If godo or appfix state file exists: Returns decision to allow the tool
3. If not active: Silent pass-through (no output)

**Hook Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration**:
```json
"PermissionRequest": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-approve.py",
        "timeout": 5
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Why this matters**: Without this hook, Claude would pause at permission dialogs for various tools (Read, Bash, Edit, etc.), requiring manual user approval. During `/godo` or `/appfix`, this breaks autonomous execution flow. The catch-all matcher (no `matcher` field) ensures ALL tools are auto-approved.

### SubagentStop Hook: Validate Agent Output

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/appfix-subagent-validator.py`

**Purpose**: Validate task agent output before accepting results during appfix to catch incomplete or placeholder responses.

**Behavior**:
1. Receives subagent completion output
2. If `APPFIX_ACTIVE=true`: Validates the output meets quality criteria
3. If validation fails: Blocks with instructions to continue
4. If not active: Silent pass-through

**Validation Criteria**:
- Output must be substantive (not too short)
- No placeholder patterns in verification claims (e.g., `[placeholder]`, `TODO`, `TBD`)
- URLs must be real app URLs (not just `/health` endpoints)
- `verification_evidence` values must contain actual content, not empty strings

**Hook Output Schema** (when blocking):
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SubagentStop",
    "additionalContext": "[validation failure message with instructions]"
  }
}
```

**Configuration**:
```json
"SubagentStop": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-subagent-validator.py",
        "timeout": 10
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Common validation failures**:
- Agent reports success but doesn't provide concrete evidence
- Agent includes placeholder URLs instead of actual deployed endpoints
- Agent claims tests passed but doesn't show actual test output
- Verification evidence fields are empty or contain only whitespace

### Stop Hook: Completion Validation with Work-Detection Loop

**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/appfix-stop-validator.py`

**Purpose**: Prevent Claude from stopping until the fix-verify loop completes. Uses git-diff work detection to keep Claude working if it made changes but didn't verify them.

**Work-Detection Logic**:

```
On Stop (APPFIX_ACTIVE=true):
│
├─► Load stop-state file (session-specific)
├─► Compute current git diff hash
├─► Compare to last saved hash
│   │
│   ├─► DIFFERENT (Claude did work)
│   │   └─► Reset consecutive_no_work_stops = 0
│   │   └─► Block: "WORK DETECTED - CONTINUE WORKING"
│   │
│   └─► SAME (Claude did no work)
│       └─► Increment consecutive_no_work_stops
│       │
│       ├─► If consecutive_no_work_stops >= 2
│       │   └─► Allow stop (Claude confirmed completion twice)
│       │
│       └─► If consecutive_no_work_stops < 2
│           └─► Block: "COMPLETION CHECK - verify or stop again"
```

**State File**: `.claude/appfix-stop-state.{session_id}.json`
```json
{
  "last_git_diff_hash": "abc123...",
  "consecutive_no_work_stops": 0,
  "last_stop_timestamp": "2026-01-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Blocking Conditions**:
- Services still unhealthy (from appfix-state.json)
- Tests haven't passed
- Work detected since last stop (git diff changed)
- Less than 2 consecutive no-work stops
- Missing `verification_evidence` when `tests_passed: true`

**Allowing Stop**:
- All services healthy + tests pass + verification evidence present (immediate)
- Max iterations (5) reached
- 2 consecutive stop attempts without any git changes (confirms completion)

### Phase 0: Pre-Flight Check

**CRITICAL**: Before any health checks, appfix MUST:

1. Check if `.claude/skills/appfix/references/service-topology.md` exists in the **PROJECT** directory
2. If missing: STOP and ask user for service URLs, create file, then proceed
3. **Never** read from `~/.claude/skills/appfix/` (global) - always use project-local path

**Why Two Consecutive Stops?**
- First no-work stop: Claude might have forgotten something
- Second no-work stop: Claude confirmed it's genuinely complete
- Prevents infinite loops while ensuring thorough verification

### Testing the Hooks

```bash
# Method 1: Test with environment variable
echo '{"tool_name":"AskUserQuestion","cwd":"/tmp","tool_input":{"questions":[{"question":"Test?","options":[{"label":"Yes"},{"label":"No"}]}]}}' | APPFIX_ACTIVE=true python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-answer.py
# Expected: JSON with autoAnswers selecting "Yes"

# Method 2: Test with state file (primary detection mechanism)
mkdir -p /tmp/test-project/.claude
echo '{"iteration": 1}' > /tmp/test-project/.claude/appfix-state.json
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","cwd":"/tmp/test-project"}' | python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-approve.py
# Expected: JSON with decision: allow

# Test without appfix active (should pass through)
rm -rf /tmp/test-project/.claude
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","cwd":"/tmp/test-project"}' | python3 ~/.claude/hooks/appfix-auto-approve.py
# Expected: No output (pass through)
```

---

## Optional Hooks (Disabled by Default)

Two additional hooks exist in `config/hooks/` but are not enabled in `settings.json`:

### skill-reminder.py

Scans user prompts for keywords and suggests relevant skills.

**Purpose**: Automatically remind Claude to use skills like `/nextjs-tanstack-stack` when relevant keywords appear.

**How it works**:
1. Receives user prompt via stdin JSON (`message` field)
2. Matches keywords against skill trigger patterns
3. Outputs suggestion like: `Consider using the Skill tool to invoke /nextjs-tanstack-stack`

**To enable**, add to `settings.json` under `UserPromptSubmit`:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "python3 ~/.claude/config/hooks/skill-reminder.py",
  "timeout": 5
}
```

**Why disabled**: Can be noisy if you don't use skills frequently. Enable if you want proactive skill suggestions.

## Tasks Deprecation Note

**Status file hooks were removed in January 2025** because Anthropic implemented native Tasks in Claude Code.

### Why Tasks Replace Status Files

The original status file system (`status-working.py`, `finalize-status-v5.py`, etc.) was a custom solution for:
- Tracking what Claude is working on
- Coordinating across sessions
- Monitoring via external UI (Mimesis)

Anthropic's native **Tasks** feature provides all of this natively with better capabilities:

| Old (Status Files) | New (Tasks) |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Custom markdown files per session | Native `~/.claude/tasks/` storage |
| Manual status updates via hooks | Automatic task tracking |
| Session-specific isolation | Cross-session coordination |
| Required hook enforcement | Built-in to Claude Code |

### Using Native Tasks

Tasks are now built into Claude Code. Key features:

```bash
# Share a task list across sessions
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project claude

# Tasks persist in ~/.claude/tasks/
# Multiple sessions can collaborate on same task list
```

**When to use Tasks**:
- Multi-step projects spanning sessions
- Subagent coordination
- Complex tasks with dependencies and blockers

**Task capabilities**:
- Dependencies between tasks
- Blockers that prevent progress
- Broadcasts when tasks are updated
- Works with `claude -p` and Agent SDK

For more details, see the official Claude Code documentation on Tasks.
