## The Five Core Skills

### `/go` — Fast Autonomous Execution
**Use when**: Quick task, you know exactly what to do.
```
/go fix the typo in README.md
```
**No planning phase** → ReAct-style direct execution → lints → commits → **8-10x faster than /melt**.

### `/melt` — Universal Task Execution
**Use when**: Complex task that benefits from multi-agent planning.
```
/melt add a logout button to the navbar
```
**Lite Heavy planning** (4 parallel Opus agents: First Principles + AGI-Pilled + 2 dynamic perspectives) → implements → lints → commits → deploys → verifies in browser → **cannot stop until done**.

### `/repair` — Unified Debugging Router
**Use when**: Something is broken (auto-detects web vs mobile).
```
/repair
```
Detects platform → routes to `/appfix` (web) or `/mobileappfix` (mobile) → **loops until healthy**.

### `/burndown` — Tech Debt Elimination
**Use when**: Codebase has accumulated slop or architecture issues.
```
/burndown src/components/
```
Consolidates `/deslop` + `/qa` into autonomous fix loop → 3 detection agents scan for issues → prioritizes by severity → **fixes iteratively** → re-scans to verify → **cannot stop until critical issues fixed**.

### `/heavy` — Multi-Perspective Analysis
**Use when**: Complex question needing broad perspectives.
```
/heavy Should we use microservices or monolith?
```
5 parallel Opus agents (2 required: **First Principles** + **AGI-Pilled**, 1 fixed: **Critical Reviewer**, 2 dynamic) → **self-educate via codebase + web + vendor docs** → tech-stack aware (Next.js, PydanticAI, Azure) → structured disagreements → adversarial dialogue → intelligence-first, never cost-first → bounded extension (max 3 rounds).

## Memory System (v4)

**Append-only event store** for cross-session learning. Events stored in `~/.claude/memory/{project-hash}/events/`.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-capture** (primary path): `stop-validator` hook archives checkpoint as LESSON-first memory event on every successful stop. Checkpoint requires `key_insight` (>30 chars), `search_terms` (2-7 concept keywords), `category` (enum), and optional `memory_that_helped` (event IDs from `<m>` tags).
2. **Manual capture** (deep captures): `/compound` skill for detailed LESSON/PROBLEM/CAUSE/FIX documentation
3. **Auto-injection**: `compound-context-loader` hook injects top 10 relevant events as structured XML at SessionStart
4. **Deterministic selection**: 4-signal scoring — entity overlap (35%) + recency (30%) + content quality (20%) + source (15%)
5. **Three-layer crash safety**:
   - `precompact-capture` (PreCompact): archives transcript before context compaction + injects summary into post-compaction context
   - `stop-validator` (Stop): structured LESSON capture on clean exit
   - `session-end-archiver` (SessionEnd): archives raw transcript on ANY exit (Ctrl+C, crash, context exhaustion)
6. **Sonnet distillation daemon**: `distill-trigger` (SessionStart) detects unprocessed raw transcripts from previous sessions, suggests background `Task(model="sonnet")` to extract structured LESSON memories via `distill-create-event.py`
7. **Entity matching**: File-path entities (basename, stem, dir) + concept entities (from `search_terms`) with substring matching
8. **Dedup**: Prefix-hash guard (8-event lookback, 60-min window) prevents duplicates
9. **Bootstrap filter**: Commit-message-level events automatically excluded from injection

### Feedback Loop & Auto-Tuning

Memory System v3 includes a closed feedback loop to improve injection quality over time:

1. **Injection logging**: `compound-context-loader` writes `injection-log.json` at SessionStart, recording which events were injected (prevents hallucinated event IDs in `memory_that_helped`)
2. **Utility tracking**: `stop-validator` validates `memory_that_helped` field against injection log, then records injection/citation counts in `manifest.json` under `"utility"` key
3. **Per-event demotion**: Events injected 3+ times with 0 citations receive a 0.5 score penalty (50% demotion), events injected 2 times with 0 citations receive 0.25 penalty
4. **Auto-tuned MIN_SCORE**: Proportional controller adjusts injection threshold based on aggregate citation rate (target: 15%). Activates after 20+ total injections, bounded to [0.05, 0.25]
5. **Stale utility cleanup**: Utility entries for deleted events are pruned during retention cleanup to keep manifest bounded

**Utility data structure** (in `manifest.json`):
```json
{
  "utility": {
    "events": {
      "evt_20260131T143022-12345-a1b2c3": {"injected": 5, "cited": 2},
      "evt_20260131T150000-67890-d4e5f6": {"injected": 3, "cited": 0}
    },
    "total_injected": 47,
    "total_cited": 8
  }
}
```

### Storage

- **Location**: `~/.claude/memory/{project-hash}/events/evt_{timestamp}.json`
- **Isolation**: Project-scoped via SHA256(git_remote_url | repo_root)
- **Retention**: 90-day TTL, 500 event cap per project
- **Format**: JSON events with atomic writes (F_FULLFSYNC + os.replace for crash safety)
- **Budget**: 10 events, 8000 chars, score-tiered (600/350/200 chars per event)

### Event Schema

```json
{
  "id": "evt_20260131T143022-12345-a1b2c3",
  "ts": "2026-01-31T14:30:22Z",
  "type": "compound",
  "content": "LESSON: <key insight>\nDONE: <what was done>",
  "entities": ["crash-safety", "atomic-write", "macOS", "_memory.py", "hooks/_memory.py"],
  "source": "compound",
  "category": "gotcha",
  "meta": {"quality": "rich", "files_changed": ["config/hooks/_memory.py"]}
}
```

### Manual Search

```bash
grep -riwl "keyword" ~/.claude/memory/*/events/
```

## Health System

**Self-monitoring instrumentation** for toolkit health. Tracks memory effectiveness, injection quality, and session diagnostics.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-capture** (at Stop): `stop-validator` archives a health snapshot after each successful stop via `_health.py`
2. **SessionStart summary**: `health-aggregator` hook prints warnings if previous session had low citation rates or excessive demotions
3. **Sidecar metrics**: `compound-context-loader` writes injection metrics, `session-snapshot` writes cleanup metrics — both read by `_health.py`
4. **Manual diagnostics**: `/health` skill generates a comprehensive report with memory health, injection effectiveness, and recommendations

### Storage

- **Location**: `~/.claude/health/{project-hash}/snapshots/health_{timestamp}.json`
- **Isolation**: Same project hash as memory system (SHA256(git_remote_url | repo_root))
- **Retention**: 30-day TTL, 100 snapshot cap
- **Schema**: Versioned (v1) with memory, injection, session, and sidecar sections

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Source | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Citation rate | manifest utility | Fraction of injected memories that were cited (target: 15%) |
| Demoted count | manifest utility | Events injected 2+ times with 0 citations |
| MIN_SCORE tuned | proportional controller | Auto-adjusted injection threshold |
| Score distribution | injection metrics sidecar | Spread of scores for injected events |

## ToolSearch (MCP Lazy Loading)

ToolSearch (`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto` in settings.json) defers MCP tool loading until needed, saving 85-95% of context tokens from tool definitions.

### Key Facts

- **Enabled by default** via `auto` mode — tools are eagerly loaded as fallback if ToolSearch fails
- **Chrome MCP is NOT affected** — `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools are injected by the Chrome extension via system prompt, not through user-configured MCP servers
- **Affected servers**: Maestro MCP and Exa MCP are user-configured and subject to lazy loading
- **Discovery pattern**: Skills use `ToolSearch(query: "server-name")` for pre-flight capability detection

### Pre-Flight Pattern

Skills with hard MCP dependencies use ToolSearch as a fail-fast check:

```
# In skill SKILL.md:
ToolSearch(query: "maestro")   # Discovers + loads Maestro MCP tools
ToolSearch(query: "exa")       # Discovers + loads Exa MCP tools
```

If the MCP server isn't configured, ToolSearch returns no results and the skill can error clearly instead of failing mysteriously mid-execution.

### Which Skills Use ToolSearch

| Skill | ToolSearch Call | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| `/mobileappfix` | `ToolSearch(query: "maestro")` | Hard dependency on Maestro MCP for E2E tests |
| `/build` (mobile path) | `ToolSearch(query: "maestro")` | Mobile verification requires Maestro MCP |
| `/heavy` (search policy) | `ToolSearch(query: "exa")` | Preferred search tool, discovered on demand |

Skills without MCP dependencies (`/go`, `/compound`, `/burndown`, `/qa`, `/deslop`) need no ToolSearch calls.

### Hooks Integration

- **exa-search-enforcer**: Reminds agents to use `ToolSearch(query: "exa")` if Exa tools aren't loaded
- **stop-validator**: Error messages reference ToolSearch discovery for Maestro tools
