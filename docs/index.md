## The Five Core Skills

### `/go` — Fast Autonomous Execution
**Use when**: Quick task, you know exactly what to do.
```
/go fix the typo in README.md
```
**No planning phase** → ReAct-style direct execution → lints → commits → **8-10x faster than /build**.

### `/build` — Universal Task Execution
**Use when**: Complex task that benefits from multi-agent planning.
```
/build add a logout button to the navbar
```
**Lite Heavy planning** (4 parallel Opus agents: First Principles + AGI-Pilled + 2 dynamic perspectives) → implements → lints → commits → deploys → verifies in browser → **cannot stop until done**.

### `/repair` — Unified Debugging Router
**Use when**: Something is broken (auto-detects web vs mobile).
```
/repair
```
Detects platform → routes to `/appfix` (web) or `/mobileappfix` (mobile) → **loops until healthy**.

### `/burndown` — Tech Debt Elimination
**Use when**: Codebase has accumulated slop or architecture issues.
```
/burndown src/components/
```
Consolidates `/deslop` + `/qa` into autonomous fix loop → 3 detection agents scan for issues → prioritizes by severity → **fixes iteratively** → re-scans to verify → **cannot stop until critical issues fixed**.

### `/heavy` — Multi-Perspective Analysis
**Use when**: Complex question needing broad perspectives.
```
/heavy Should we use microservices or monolith?
```
5 parallel Opus agents (2 required: **First Principles** + **AGI-Pilled**, 1 fixed: **Critical Reviewer**, 2 dynamic) → **self-educate via codebase + web + vendor docs** → tech-stack aware (Next.js, PydanticAI, Azure) → structured disagreements → adversarial dialogue → intelligence-first, never cost-first → bounded extension (max 3 rounds).

## Memory System

**Append-only event store** for cross-session learning. Events stored in `~/.claude/memory/{project-hash}/events/`.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-capture** (primary path): `stop-validator` hook archives checkpoint as memory event on every successful stop
2. **Manual capture** (deep captures): `/compound` skill for detailed problem documentation
3. **Auto-injection**: `compound-context-loader` hook injects top 5 relevant events at SessionStart
4. **Scoring**: Events ranked by recency (60%) + entity overlap (40%)

### Storage

- **Location**: `~/.claude/memory/{project-hash}/events/evt_{timestamp}.json`
- **Isolation**: Project-scoped via SHA256(git_remote_url | repo_root)
- **Retention**: 90-day TTL, 500 event cap per project
- **Format**: JSON events with atomic writes (F_FULLFSYNC + os.replace for crash safety)

### Event Schema

```json
{
  "id": "evt_20260131T143022-12345-a1b2c3",
  "ts": "2026-01-31T14:30:22Z",
  "type": "compound",
  "content": "Learning summary (1-5 sentences)",
  "entities": ["file.py", "concept", "tool"],
  "source": "compound",
  "meta": {"session_context": "..."}
}
```

### Manual Search

```bash
grep -riwl "keyword" ~/.claude/memory/*/events/
```
