## Architectural Decisions

### Status File Enforcement (2026-01-09, updated)
**Decision**: Two-phase enforcement - checklist visibility AND status blocking.

**Why**: Need both: (1) Full checklist always shown on first stop, (2) Status file actually enforced before allowing stop.

**Implementation**:
- First stop: Show full checklist with status as item 0 (if failed)
- Second stop: Check status again - block if still stale, allow if fresh
- This ensures checklist is never bypassed AND status is always enforced
