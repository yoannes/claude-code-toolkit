description: Exhaustive codebase audit for architectural health, maintainability, and scalability
---

## Execution Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use plan mode and parallel agents for this audit.**

### Phase 1: Strategic Exploration (Plan Mode)
Use `EnterPlanMode` to research before generating findings. Launch up to 3 parallel `Task` agents with `subagent_type=Explore`:

**Agent 1 - Size & Complexity Census:**
- Find all files > 300 lines
- Find all functions > 50 lines
- Map high-complexity areas and nesting depth

**Agent 2 - Architecture & Coupling:**
- Map import graph across modules
- Find circular dependencies
- Identify cross-domain imports and layer violations

**Agent 3 - Patterns & Consistency:**
- Catalog error handling patterns across codebase
- Find naming convention inconsistencies
- Identify dead code and unused exports

**Agent 4 - Configuration Resilience:**
- Find all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and `process.env.*` usages
- Detect fallback patterns: `|| 'http://localhost'`, `?? ''`
- Trace auth cascade paths (what triggers `clearToken`/`logout`)
- Validate static links against actual routes

### Phase 2: Synthesis
After agents return, synthesize findings in the plan file:
- Cross-reference findings to identify systemic issues
- Group related violations for batch refactoring
- Prioritize by risk (scalability, maintainability, security)

### Phase 3: Report Generation
Exit plan mode and generate the final report using the synthesized findings.

Conduct an exhaustive audit of the ENTIRE codebase for architectural health, maintainability, and scalability. Use extended thinking to thoroughly analyze every finding.

**Scope: Leave No Stone Unturned.**
- Scan EVERY source file in the repository — do not sample or spot-check.
- Trace import graphs and data flows completely, not just surface-level inspection.
- Examine every module boundary, every public interface, every integration point.
- Check both the "happy path" code AND error handling, edge cases, and fallback logic.

**Your Priorities (in order):**

**1. File Size & Complexity Violations (Complete Census):**
Analyze EVERY file in the codebase:
- Catalog ALL files exceeding 500 lines of code (list every one, no exceptions).
- Catalog ALL files exceeding 300 lines (as early warning candidates).
- For each oversized file, assess: is the length justified (auto-generated, lookup tables, single cohesive domain) or does it indicate a need to decompose?
- Flag ALL functions/methods exceeding 50 lines.
- Flag ALL functions with cyclomatic complexity > 10 or deep nesting (> 4 levels).
- Flag ALL React components exceeding 200 lines or rendering logic exceeding 100 lines.
- Identify files with too many exports (> 10 public exports suggests unfocused module).

**2. Separation of Concerns Violations (Layer by Layer):**
Systematically check each architectural layer for responsibility bleeding:

*Frontend (React/TS):*
- Components containing business logic, data fetching, AND presentation — all three should be separated.
- Components directly calling APIs instead of going through a data layer.
- Business logic living in components instead of hooks/services.
- UI state mixed with server state.
- Styling logic mixed with behavioral logic.

*Backend (Python):*
- Route handlers containing business logic instead of delegating to services.
- Services directly accessing database/ORM instead of going through repositories.
- Validation logic scattered across layers instead of centralized.
- Domain objects knowing about HTTP, serialization, or infrastructure.

*Cross-cutting:*
- Files that import from unrelated domains (map out every cross-domain import).
- "God objects" or "god files" that have become dumping grounds (> 5 unrelated responsibilities).
- Utility files that have grown into catch-all junk drawers.
- Shared folders that contain domain-specific code that shouldn't be shared.

**3. Abstraction & Coupling Issues (Full Dependency Analysis):**
Map the complete dependency graph and flag:

*Coupling Violations:*
- Modules reaching deep into other modules' internals (accessing non-public members, importing from nested paths like `../../../other-module/internals/private`).
- Feature modules importing from other feature modules instead of shared abstractions.
- Circular dependencies or import cycles (list every cycle found).
- Implicit coupling through shared mutable state.
- Temporal coupling (code that only works if called in a specific order).

*Abstraction Violations:*
- Leaky abstractions: implementation details (DB schemas, API response shapes, third-party library types) exposed across boundaries.
- Wrong abstraction level: high-level modules depending on low-level details.
- Missing abstractions: raw primitives passed around where domain types should exist.
- Over-abstraction: unnecessary interfaces, abstract classes, or indirection with only one implementation and no foreseeable variants.

*Configuration & Hardcoding:*
- Hardcoded values that should be environment configuration (URLs, credentials, feature flags, limits).
- Magic numbers/strings without named constants (catalog every instance).
- Environment-specific logic embedded in code instead of configuration.

*Duplication:*
- Copy-pasted logic (flag 2+ instances, not just 3+) — include line counts and locations.
- Near-duplicate functions that vary by only 1-2 lines.
- Repeated structural patterns that should be abstracted (e.g., same try/catch/log pattern everywhere).

**4. Scalability Red Flags (Systematic Review):**
Examine every data flow path for scalability issues:

*Data Fetching & Queries:*
- N+1 patterns: loops containing queries, awaits, or API calls.
- Missing pagination on ALL queries and API responses that return lists.
- Queries without limits that could return unbounded results.
- Missing database indexes for common query patterns (infer from query shapes).
- Full table scans or SELECT * patterns.

*Async & Concurrency:*
- Synchronous blocking operations that should be async (file I/O, network calls, heavy computation on main thread).
- Sequential awaits that could be parallelized (Promise.all / asyncio.gather).
- Missing concurrency limits on parallel operations (could spawn thousands of requests).
- Race conditions in shared state access.
- Missing timeouts on external calls.

*Memory & Resources:*
- Unbounded data structures: lists, maps, caches that grow without limits.
- Missing cleanup: event listeners not removed, subscriptions not unsubscribed, connections not closed.
- Large objects held in memory longer than necessary.
- Accumulating state in long-lived processes.

*State & Caching:*
- In-memory caches without TTL or invalidation strategy.
- State that won't survive multiple instances (sticky sessions required but not documented).
- Missing cache layers where repeated expensive operations occur.
- Stale reads from caches without invalidation on writes.

*Frontend-Specific:*
- Unbounded lists rendering without virtualization.
- Missing memoization on expensive derived computations (legitimate cases, not over-memoization).
- Re-renders cascading due to unstable references in context or props.
- Large bundle sizes from uncode-split imports.

**5. Maintainability Debt (Complete Inventory):**
Flag ALL code that will slow down future development:

*Consistency Violations:*
- Inconsistent patterns for the same problem across the codebase (list each pattern and where each variant appears).
- Inconsistent naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case mixing, inconsistent prefixes/suffixes).
- Inconsistent error handling approaches.
- Inconsistent file/folder organization across similar modules.

*Dead Code (Exhaustive):*
- Unused exports (not imported anywhere).
- Unused functions, classes, components (not called anywhere).
- Unreachable branches (conditions that can never be true).
- Commented-out code blocks (every instance).
- Unused dependencies in package.json / requirements.txt.
- Feature flags that are permanently on/off.
- Dead feature folders (code for removed features still present).

*Type Safety Gaps:*
- Python: untyped public APIs, missing return types, `Any` usage, `# type: ignore` comments.
- TypeScript: `any` usage (every instance), type assertions (`as`), non-null assertions, `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` comments.
- Stringly-typed logic that should use enums/unions.
- Runtime type checks that indicate missing compile-time types.

*Error Handling Gaps:*
- Empty catch blocks that swallow errors silently.
- Generic exception catching without specific handling.
- Missing error boundaries in React component trees.
- Errors logged but not propagated or handled.
- User-facing errors exposing internal details.

*Testability Blockers:*
- Hard dependencies that can't be mocked (direct imports of singletons, static methods).
- Side effects in constructors or module initialization.
- Global mutable state.
- Tight coupling to external services without abstraction.

**6. Security & Reliability Red Flags (Bonus Pass):**
While auditing, also note:
- SQL/NoSQL injection risks (string concatenation in queries).
- Unsanitized user input rendered in UI (XSS risks).
- Secrets or credentials in code (even if env vars, note any hardcoded fallbacks).
- Missing input validation on API boundaries.
- Missing rate limiting on public endpoints.
- Overly permissive CORS or authentication gaps.
