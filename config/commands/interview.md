description: Interview user to clarify plan details and resolve ambiguities
---

Interview me in appropriate detail using the AskUserQuestion tool about this plan. Ensure there is no remaining ambiguity before proceeding.

Ask questions about things I may have forgotten to tell you:
- Edge cases and error handling expectations
- Integration points with existing systems
- Performance requirements or constraints
- User experience preferences
- Testing and validation criteria
- Deployment or rollout considerations

Use multiple rounds of questions if needed. Do not proceed with implementation until the plan is fully clarified.
